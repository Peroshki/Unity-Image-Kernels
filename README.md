# Unity 3D Kernel Demo

A demonstration of image processing using kernel transformations in Unity 3D. Two different image kernels are used in this project, one to blur an image using a Gaussian Blur approximation, and one to sharpen an image. Hosted at https://peroshki.github.io/Unity-Image-Kernels/

## Controls
| Key        | Action           |

| W/A/S/D | Move Camera     |
| Z/X      | Zoom In/Out |
